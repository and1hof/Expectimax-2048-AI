# Expectimax-2048-AI
An AI agent which can routinely beat the game 2048 by expecting several tile spawns in the future and calculating optimal moves based on a number of heuristics.

### PREREQUISITES
A JavaScript-enabled web browser is all that is needed to play this variation of 2048.

### GETTING STARTED
Download the repo as a .zip, unzip it on your desktop and double-click the index.html.

### USAGE
The AI agent itself is contained within the /js subdirectory in the file "agent.js".

### WHATS IMPLEMENTED
- Agent regularly achieves the 2048 tile, resulting in a winning game state
- Agent is fast, moving as much as 15 times per second depending on hardware

### TODO
- Optimize the agent to reach the 4096 tile
- Perform expectation several moves ahead, instead of expecting possible tile spawns at immediate next move
